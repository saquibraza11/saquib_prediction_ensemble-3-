💼 Salary Prediction Using Ensemble Techniques

📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts an individual's salary based on features like education, experience, job role, location, etc., using ensemble learning techniques.

🧠 Overview

Salary prediction is a regression task where ensemble methods are employed to improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, and boost performance. This project explores and compares multiple ensemble algorithms to determine the most effective model for predicting salaries.

📊 Techniques Used

Random Forest Regressor – Bagging technique combining multiple decision trees.

Gradient Boosting Regressor – Boosting technique improving model performance iteratively.

XGBoost – Optimized gradient boosting with regularization.

LightGBM – Fast, scalable gradient boosting framework by Microsoft.

Voting Regressor – Combines multiple regressors by averaging their predictions.
